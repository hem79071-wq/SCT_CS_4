🔹 Task Title:
Basic Keylogging Simulation Using Python

🔹 Objective of the Task:
The main objective of this task is to learn how user keyboard input can be captured and stored using a Python program. The task helps in understanding how keystrokes (user-entered text) can be logged in a controlled and ethical manner.

🔹 Description of the Task:
In this task, a simple keylogging simulation is implemented using Python in Google Colab. The program asks the user to enter text through the keyboard and records the entered input with the user’s consent. Each input is stored in a text file for future reference.

This task does not perform background keylogging or unauthorized data collection. It is designed purely for educational purposes.

🔹 Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Platform: Google Colab
Version Control: GitHub

🔹 Working of the Program:
The program continuously prompts the user to enter text.
Each entered text is written into a file named key_log.txt.
The logging process continues until the user types EXIT.
After stopping, the stored keystrokes can be viewed from the output file.

🔹 Learning Outcomes:
Understanding user input handling in Python
Learning file handling operations (write and append)
Gaining experience with Google Colab
Using GitHub for project upload and version control

🔹 Ethical Consideration:
This task follows ethical guidelines by logging only user-entered text with full consent. It does not involve real-time background keylogging or privacy violation.
